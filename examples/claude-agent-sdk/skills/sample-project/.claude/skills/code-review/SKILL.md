# Code Review Skill

Review the provided code for:

1. **Bugs**: Logic errors, off-by-one errors, null/undefined handling
2. **Security**: Input validation, injection vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets
3. **Best practices**: Naming conventions, error handling, code structure

Format your review as a list of findings with severity (high/medium/low) and suggested fixes.
